# 42 Common Core Projects

This README is the main portfolio index for my GitHub repositories.
The first section focuses on my school projects from [School 42 (Heilbronn)](https://www.42heilbronn.de/).

School 42 is a software engineering program based on **project-based learning** and a **peer-to-peer system**:
- no traditional lectures
- students learn by building real projects
- progress is validated through peer evaluations and practical defense

For employers, this means strong hands-on skills, autonomy, and the ability to explain and review technical decisions.

At School 42, I am developing the following skills:

- Technical skills: C programming, algorithms and data structures, Makefile-based build systems, Linux system administration basics, shell scripting, debugging, and Git/GitHub workflow.
- Soft skills: code review and peer evaluation, technical project defense, clear communication, teamwork, autonomy, and problem solving under constraints.
